## General info
This is a simple webpage created with the purpouse of testing the knowledge I have adquired in HTML.
It will display recipes of my choise and serves as a 1st project realized using the technologies taught in the Odin Project Foundation Course.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Ubuntu CLI
* Git and GitHub repository
* HTML5

## Reflection
I found this project to be a valuable excercise to start combining the technologies taught in the TOP curriculum without feeling overwelmed.
The website looks astonishing and flashy? Not quite, but I found it to be clean and aesthetic in his simplicity
Have I became the ultimate programmer after compleating it? Most certainly not, but I do feel a lot more confident with the use of Git, HTML and the Ubuntu CLI. Being an absolute beginner in the 3 of them I think it is sufficient for the moment.
I cant wait to dive in the next lessons and eventually, come back to this excercise and see how much can I actually improve it.
