         <h3>Description</h3>
         <p>There may be no more beloved Italian dish than carbonara: hot pasta tossed with a creamy sauce of raw beaten eggs, accentuated with crisp bits of guanciale, and finished with a shower of grated aged Pecorino Romano cheese plus freshly ground black pepper. While it is also made with fettuccine, linguine, or bucatini, spaghetti remains the canonical carbonara pasta shape, and the classic recipe contains no butter, cream, or garlic.</p>
         <p>Because the name comes from the word carbonaro, “coal burner,” some believe the dish was created as a hearty easy-to-make meal by men working outdoors for long periods.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <p>Ingredients for 4 person:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti 320 g</li>
            <li>Egg Yolks 6 pz</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Guanciale 150 g</li>
            <li>Pecorino Romano DOP 50 g</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>To prepare the spaghetti with carbonara start by putting on the fire a pot with salted water to cook the Pasta.
            <li>remove the rind from the pillow and cut it first into slices and then striped stripes about 1cm thick.</li> 
            <p><em>advanced rind can be reused to flavor other preparations.</em></p>

            <li>Pour the pieces of guanciale into a non-stick pan and brown for about 10 minutes over medium high heat, be careful not to burn it otherwise it will release a too strong aroma.</li>
            <li>Dive the spaghetti in boiling in water and cook them al dente.</li>
            <li>Pour the yolks in a bowl. Add the Pecorino and season with black pepper. Mix everything with a hand whisk, until you get a smooth cream.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, il Guanciale will have completed his cooking; turn off the heat and use a ladle to extract it from the pan, leaving the cooking bottom inside the pan.</li> 
            <li>Transfer the pillow into a bowl and keep it aside. Pour a ladle of pasta water in a pan, along with the fat of the pillow.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta al dente directly in the pan with the cooking bottom</li>
            <li>Jump it briefly to flavor. Remove from heat and pour the mixture of eggs and Pecorino into the pan.
            <strong>Stir fast to amalgamate</strong></li>
            <li>To make it very creamy, as needed, you can add a <em>little</em> cooking water of the pasta.</li>
            <li>Add the guanciale, stir one last time and serve the spaghetti with carbonara immediately adding pecorino on the surface and a pinch of black pepper.</li>
         </ol>
