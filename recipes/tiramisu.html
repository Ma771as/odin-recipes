        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Tiramisù is a velvety mélange of savoiardi cookies dipped in an espresso, layered with delicately sweetened whipped eggs and mascarpone cheese, and topped with a dusting of cocoa powder.</p>
        <p>Its name, tirami sù, means “pick me up,” perhaps a reference to the stimulating effects of the caffeine in the recipe’s espresso and chocolate. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Ingredients for a baking tray of 30x20 cm:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mascarpone 750 g</li>
            <li>Savoiardi 250 g</li>
            <li>Espresso Coffee (from Moka) 300 g</li>
            <li>Fresh Eggs 260 g</li>
            <li>Sugar 120</li>
            <li>Bitter cocoa powder</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Separate eggs by dividing egg whites from yolks1.</li>
            <p><em>remember that to mount the egg whites well they will not have to present any trace of yolk.</em></p>
            <li>Whip the egg yolks with electric whisks, pouring only half a dose of sugar. As soon as the mixture has become clear and frothy, and with the whips still in operation, you can add the mascarpone, little by little</li>
            <li>Incorporated all the cheese you will have obtained a thick and compact cream; keep it aside.</li>
            <li>Clean the whips very well and go on to whip the egg whites. When they are foamy, pour the remaining sugar a little at a time</li>
            <p>It has to be mounted <stron>a Neve</stron>, the result is the right one when turning the bowl upside down the mix does not fall. </p>
            <li>Take a spoonful of egg whites and pour it into the bowl with mascarpone cream and stir vigorously with a spatula, so you can dilute the compound. Then proceed to add the remaining part of the egg whites, little by little by stirring very gently from the bottom up</li>
            <li>Distribute a generous spoonful of the resulting mix on the bottom of a glass baking dish, large 30x199.5cm and distributed well on the entire base. </li>
            <li>Soak for a few moments the savoiardi in the cold coffee first on one side and then on the other.</li>
            <li>Hand distribute the savoiardi soaked in the baking dish, trying to arrange them all in one direction, so as to obtain a first layer of biscuits</li>
            <li>Add more cream to the mascarpone and level it to cover them completely</li>
            <li>And keep distributing the savoyards soaked in coffee, then make another layer of cream and level the surface well</li>
            <li>Transfer the remaining cream into a <em>sac-à-poche</em> with smooth spout 12 mm in diameter and make tufts for the entire size of the pan</li>
            <li>Sprinkle it with bitter cocoa powder and let firm in the refrigerator for a couple of hours</li>
         </ol>
